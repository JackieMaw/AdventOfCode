(Program authors should be especially cautious; attempting to execute div with b=0 
or attempting to execute mod with a<0 or b<=0 will cause the program to crash and might even damage the ALU. 
These operations are never intended in any serious ALU program.)

FORMULA #2

divisor = 26
param1 = -16
param2 = 7

z1 	= (z0 div 26) x (25x + 1) + (w + param2) * x 
	
x = 0: if (z0 mod 26) + param1 == w
x = 1: if (z0 mod 26) + param1 != w

if x = 0:
z1 	= (z0 div 26) x (25x + 1) + (w + param2) * x 
	= z0 div 26 *scaling down
	
if x = 1:
z1 	= (z0 div 26) x (25x + 1) + (w + param2) * x 
	= 26 x (z0 div 26) + w + param2 *scaling up

z starts at 0 and must end at zero
we really need x = 0 in order to scale down z

to make x = 0 we must have:
	(z0 mod 26) + param1 = w
	z0 mod 26 - 16 = w
	
we know z0 because we have it computed from the previous formula
so we can uniquely determine w
