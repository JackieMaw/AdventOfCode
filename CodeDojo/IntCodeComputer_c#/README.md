# Advent of Code - Code Dojo - The IntCode Computer

## c# Starter Project

This is a started project for C# developers. I have setup a basic testing framework for executing the challenges.
I have entered the input data and corresponding answers from my personal account.
If you'd like to earn starts on your own AoC account you can can replace the InputData.
If you run the tests, you will see that 2a has already been done for you.

## Building the IntCode Computer 

### Day 2 - Advent of Code 2019         
Build your first version of the IntCode computer, which copies the program to memory and executes it, supporting operations Add & Multiply. 

### Day 5 - Advent of Code 2019         
Extend your IntCode computer to support new operations Input & Output. Add support for immediate & position parameter modes. Add new operations for Jump, Less Than and Equals.

### Day 9 - Advent of Code 2019         
Complete your Intcode computer by expanding the memory, and adding support for relative parameter mode.

### Day 17 - Advent of Code 2019*      
Add support for ASCII input/output to solve a 2-dimensional traversal problem.

* you do not need to solve this challenge in order to attempt Day 25 â€“ you only need ascii support

### Day 25 - Advent of Code 2019       
Play a text-based game, moving between rooms, picking up and putting down items, to find the secret password.
(no coding - this one is just for fun)
